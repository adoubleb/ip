## Record of AI use in this Project

AI Tools used in this project:
1. JetBrains AI assistant chat
2. JetBrains AI assistant auto-complete

Taks aided by AI:
1. Auto generation of Javadocs
    * Observation: The javadocs generated were very comprehensive and described the method well. 
    * Time saved: Huge time savings since I needed to only check the generated javadoc instead of 
      writing from scratch
2. Advice on design
    * Asked AI assistant on how to link the Chatbot logic with the GUI
3. Code auto-completion
    * Observation: There are pros and cons. For straightforward task such as autocompleting loops or
      reassigning a variable and writing test cases it works well. But for designing a whole class
      or interactions between classes it seems to get confused and overcomplicate matters.
4. Code quality checks
    * I attached some files to the AI assistant for it to comb through and find code quality problems.
      I found it to be useful as it offers some useful advice such as to extract methods and it even offers
      the code for the method and you can easily integrate it into the codebase using a button.
